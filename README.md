# IoT and CPS for Peatland Fire Detection, Mitigation, and Prevention
(September 2022 – December 2022)

*Abstract:* Peatlands are one of the world’s largest carbon sinks, storing more than twice the amount of carbon stored in forests. However, rising temperatures and illegal peatland draining have increased the occurrence of unforeseen and uncontrollable fires. This study’s proposal uses IoT, WSN, LoRa, CPS, and ML to create an integrated network of sensory nodes gathering live data on specific parameters including temperature, humidity, CO levels, and light intensity. The data is synchronized through a microcontroller and wirelessly transmitted to a LoRa gateway. Using ANN, machine learning algorithms process the parameter data’s position on the Fire Weather Index (FWI). Should a region be classified as having a fire, local firefighters would be communicated the exact location and canal settings automatically adjusted to increase water flow. The unique communication and indexing capabilities employed is deemed to help peatland-abundant countries effectively mitigate the negative environmental, economic, and social impacts of peatland fires.
